# Electric-Charges
Simulation of electric charges.Implemented with SFML in C++
### TODO:
* Physics
  * Collisions with other primitives(rectangle, line)
  * Angular momentum
  * Coulomb's law
* Add shaders for highlighting
* Multithreading
* Camera zoom
* Control time(stop, change speed)
* Walls, bounding boxes
* Fields(Gravitational, electrical)
* Show field gridlines and field lines
* Tools: orbit charge, create field
* GUI
